.csv files with values used for the final graphs are stored here. 
The name of plot usually corresponds to the name of .cvs data table.

### Common values per pipeline ### 

Pipeline name:      Ct_ddCt-normalised.R
...
Control_ct_mean:    Mean Ct values of housekeeping gene, per condition
dCt:                Difference between Ct values of target gene and mean of housekeeping gene
Control_dct_mean:   Mean dCt values of control condition
ddCt:               Difference between dCt values and mean dCt values from control condition
log2_ddct:          2^-ddCt (relative abundance value)
mock_mean_log:      Average control condition relative abundance value
Value_norm:         Relative abundance value normalised to levels in control condition
...

Pipeline name:      copy_number_gapdh_factorised.R
